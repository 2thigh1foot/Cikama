###### Functionality

* Need to figure out what language we want to write this in? We can model phone apps in React, - We made this a web application instead using Flask for the backend, and basic HTML, CSS, and  Vue.js for the frontend.
* Take a picture of a plant (We will need photo album access) - We didn't use a phone application, so we felt it would be better to allow the user to search for their plant instead.
* Be able to ID plant (Trained Model for plant types) - We weren't able to get to the ML portion of our project due to lack of time. 
* Grab local UV and important flower data - We make API calls that give us the local weather data, but we ended up not using that at all. We are able to grab flower data and display their specific data to users.

* Asks for a user's zip code to find local UV information to formulate the best conditions and feeding regiment for said plant. Also notifies the user about when they should water the plant and do other things regarding cultivating a healthy plant.
